# OWFasterLoadAssetBundles

A port of https://github.com/DiFFoZ/BepInExFasterLoadAssetBundles for Outer Wilds.

# BepInExFasterLoadAssetBundles
Makes startup loading time faster by **2%**.

## What it does
Before loading asset bundles, they will be decompressed into `Lethal Company Game/Cache/AssetBundles`. Decompressing can help with slow loading of asset bundles or high RAM usage.
